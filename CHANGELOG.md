# Changelog

Notable changes to `gnr8`. Entries under **Unreleased** land in the next release; the
[release runbook](docs/RELEASE.md) chooses `patch` or `minor` based on whether this section
contains a **Breaking** heading.

Cargo treats `0.x.y → 0.x.(y+1)` as a compatible upgrade, so any release with breaking changes
must move the minor version.

## Unreleased

### Breaking

The generated-SDK surface and the code-as-config API are now purely native. Everything whose
purpose was to make gnr8's output resemble another generator's is gone, permanently — see rule 0
in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md), enforced by `make invariants`.

Removed public API (no replacement; these were compatibility surface):

- Modules `gnr8::sdk::go`, `gnr8::sdk::openapi_compat`, `gnr8::sdk::profile`, `gnr8::sdk::surface`,
  `gnr8::sdk::typescript`.
- `SdkProfile`, `SdkTypeAliases`, `SdkOperationAliases`, `OpenApiSchemaAliases`, `QueryParam`.
- Go target controls `RequiredPointerConstructorPolicy`, `QueryTimeFormat`, `GoRequestBuilderScope`,
  `GoRequestBuilderAliases`, `GoRequestBuilderOperationAliases`, `GoQuerySetterArgumentPolicy`,
  `GoExecuteCompatibility`.
- TypeScript target controls `TsModelPropertyPolicy`, `TsNullablePolicy`, `TsResponsePolicy`,
  `TsBarrelExports`.
- Builder methods `.aliases()`, `.profile()`, `.type_alias()`, `.error_model()`,
  `.schema_aliases()`, `.request_body_param_name()`, `.init_override_function()` on the SDK and
  OpenAPI targets, and `ApiOverrides::query_param()`.
- `DiagnosticCategory::Compatibility`, `runner::BUNDLE_VERSION`, the deprecated `Artifacts::write`,
  and `Pipeline::post_write`.

Migration: use `RenameOperation` / `RenameType` to choose one canonical public name,
`SdkFileLayout` / `OperationFileSplit` / `SdkPackageMetadata` for shape, `RequestParameter` +
`ParameterOverride` in place of `QueryParam`, and `Artifacts::create` / `overlay` / `rewrite` in
place of `Artifacts::write`. Preserving a previous generator's exact SDK surface is a non-goal.

Behaviour changes in generated SDKs:

- Operations whose security cannot be satisfied now fail before the request is built
  (`AuthConfigurationError` in all three languages) instead of silently sending an unauthenticated
  request. Clients that supply credentials from the transport (a signing round-tripper, an
  authenticating proxy, a request hook) opt out with `WithTransportAuth()` (Go),
  `auth_transport=True` (Python), or `authMode: "transport"` (TypeScript).
- Go no longer emits the duplicate suffix-style enum constants (`FictionGenre`); only the prefix
  form (`GenreFiction`) remains.
- TypeScript enums are emitted as a runtime const object plus a derived type, so the name is now a
  value export rather than a type-only export.
- `204` responses are treated as bodyless.

Wire format: `Artifact::producer` is required in the artifact bundle; bundles written by older
versions no longer deserialize.

### Fixed

- **TypeScript SDKs were unusable in browsers.** The global `fetch` was captured unbound and then
  invoked as a method, so the receiver was the client and every call threw `Illegal invocation`.
- **Retry waits were unbounded and uninterruptible** in all three languages. A `Retry-After` header
  is now capped at 60s and the wait observes cancellation. Transport-error retries back off
  exponentially instead of reconnecting instantly.
- TypeScript did not release discarded retry response bodies, holding sockets out of the pool.
- Optional security (`security: [{}, {Scheme: []}]`) silently sent no credentials, because the
  always-satisfiable anonymous alternative shadowed every credentialed one.
- Security alternatives were reordered alphabetically, discarding the author's preference order.
- Generated Python referenced credential attributes that were never assigned, raised
  `OverflowError` for very large `max_retries`, omitted `AuthConfigurationError` from the package
  barrel, emitted path parameters without type annotations, and tripped `RET503`.
- Generated TypeScript failed `tsc --noUnusedLocals`, `--exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, and
  `--noUncheckedIndexedAccess`; all three are now gated in CI.
- Go: the request context was cancelled before the caller could read the response body; non-string
  path parameters did not compile; multipart parts now carry real filenames.
- Go middleware is now resolved in statement order, so a `Use(...)` registered after a route no
  longer secures it retroactively, and middleware propagates through helper functions that take a
  `*gin.RouterGroup`.
- The Go extractor no longer reads the `swaggertype` struct tag; a source type's real Go type is
  the only source of truth.
- Failed subprocesses report the actionable end of their output instead of only the first line.
